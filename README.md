  This is Fasm.ga
</h3>

We created Fasm.ga for all your URL shortening needs. It's completely free, and does **not** rely on **ads**, **commercial tracking** or **selling your data** to maintain. We don't log your IP or collect any of your navigation data.

It's quite straightforward. You input a URL, and __we make it shorter__.

<h4 align="center">
  Free
</h4>

Fasm.ga's core is, and forever will be, **completely free**. We will never charge you or ask you for your money for anything.

<h4 align="center">
  Ad–less
</h4>

We do not use annoying ads on our website home or redirect page. There's always **nothing else** between **you and your link**.

<h4 align="center">
  Simple
</h4>

Fasm.ga is, and forever will be, extremely simple and straightforward to use. Fundamentally, it's __just__ a URL shortener. It doesn't need a page-tall hero talking about how awesome we are with tons of different buttons and redirect links to other pages stating how awesome we are and then the part where you get to use it.

<h4 align="center">
  Secure
</h4>

We don't log your IP address in cleartext, and instead **encrypt** it in a **one–way undeciferable hash** (SHA–256) so that we can identify links that come from a certain user. This also applies to your password and login details.

<h4 align="center">
  Open source
</h4>

Our code is open. Because why not. After all, it's how everything should be.

<h4 align="center">
  fasmga++;
</h4>

We have hosting fees, and we need a way to pay them.
fasmga++; is a small tip that gives you some advanced (and, for the average user, useless) features like CAPTCHAs and automatized edits/deletions for your URLs.
Anyway the Fasm.ga code is and will forever be entirely open source. You can use it, but **__you SHOULD follow the [Fasm.ga OSS License](https://www.fasmga.org/license)__**.
